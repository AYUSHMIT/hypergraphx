## What are higher-order networks?

## Library highlights
   * **Motif analysis** is a fundamental tool in network science to describe networked systems at their microscale, identifying their structural and functional building blocks. We provide an implementation for **higher-order motif analysis**: overabundant subgraphs of nodes connected by higher-order interactions. Given their widespread applications and expected use on large-scale real-world datasets, we also provide an approximated algorithm for higher-order motif analysis based on hyperedge sampling that speeds up computations while maintaining accuracy.
